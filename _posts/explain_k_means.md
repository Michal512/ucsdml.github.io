excerpt: Robustness often leads to lower test accuracy, which is undesirable. We prove that (i) if the dataset is separated, then there always exists a robust and accurate classifier, and (ii) this classifier can be obtained by rounding a locally Lipschitz function. Empirically, we verify that popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet) are separated, and we show that neural networks with a small local Lipschitz constant indeed have high test accuracy and robustness.
